# 7MinutesWorkoutApp

7 Minutes Workout app is an Android App, built in Kotlin. It makes its user to work out daily, by motivating them with quotes, and it shows how to do specific workouts. It has a BMI Calculator built in, and Text to speech module that tells the user what workout should he do now (so he does not have to look at the screen all the time). I have implemented Material Design 3 and also Material Dynamic Colors theming for android 12 and higher. Here's some screenshots:
